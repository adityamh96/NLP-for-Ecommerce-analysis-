# NLP-for-Ecommerce-analysis-

## Motivation:

• Product recommendation has been a game changer for the e-commerce industry. Organizations which have access to large volumes of user data have a great potential to build robust recommendation engines which can help make key decisions. 

• Some of these decisions include what product is a customer likely to buy given his past purchase history, based on the reviews provided by the customer is he likely to buy products from a particular brand or to predict products that fall within the customers price range. 

• All of these decisions can now be made by using state of the art machine learning and deep learning algorithms. But the key part is to understand what kind of data these algorithms should be fed in order to make impactful decisions. 

• So, our aim is to understand if we can determine similar users solely based on their reviews and make product recommendations based on these similarities. Also, to understand if based on just the text reviews can we predict product categories, this will help us understand if there are any specific keywords that are used more than often for a particular product category. 

## Tasks:
1.	The main objective of the project was finding similarities between users based on text reviews provided by them for a particular product category. 

2.	The second main objective of the project included predicting product categories based on just the reviews given by the users.

## Models:

• KNN

• Naive Bayes

• Keras Sequential model

• CNN

• LSTM (RNN)
